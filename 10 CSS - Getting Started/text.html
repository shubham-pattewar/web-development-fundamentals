    <h3>Premiere</h3>
    <p>
        Following the success of the Fantastic Four in 1961 and the subsequent revival of American comic books featuring superheroes, 
        Marvel Comics created new superhero characters. Stan Lee developed the initial concept for Iron Man.[1] He wanted to design a 
        character who should be unpalatable to his generally anti-war readers but to make them like the character anyway.[2] Iron Man 
        was created in the years after a permanent arms industry developed in the United States, and this was incorporated into the 
        character's backstory.

    <h3>Solo Series</h3>
    <p>
        [3] The character was introduced as an active player in the Vietnam War. Lee described the national mood
        toward Vietnam during Iron Man's creation as "a time when most of us genuinely felt that the conflict in that tortured land 
        really was a simple matter of good versus evil".

    <h2>Fiction character Biography</h2>
    <p>
        Shortly after his creation, 
        Iron Man became a founding member of the superhero team, the Avengers, alongside Thor, Ant-Man, the Wasp, and the Hulk. Iron Man 
        stories, individually and with the Avengers, have been published consistently since the character's creation.
